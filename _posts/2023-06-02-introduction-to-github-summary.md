In this module, I learned about the key features of GitHub, including issues, commits, and pull requests. I also used GitHub Pages to publish a public site based on the contents of my project.

I learned about:
* Communicating with the project community in issues
* Managing notifications for project events
* Creating branches to manage work in parallel
* Making commits to update project source
* Introducing changes with pull requests
* Deploying a web page to GitHub Pages
* Differences between Git and GitHub and the roles they play in the software development lifecycle
* How a repository fork differs from a clone
* Repository labels and where to apply them in issues and pull requests
